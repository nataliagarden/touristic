	<h1>Me at Istanbul</h1>

	<p class="firstpar">Have you ever been someplace and you wished to spend your whole life there? it wasnt the case for me when i visited Istanbul.
	Let's give Istanbul some credits. This capital of Turkey with a huge history can fullfill your passion if you have passion for history, in fact,
	If stones were given a tongue , they would talk. The second advantage of Istanbul is somehow considered cheap for people who comes from Europe , North America, and Australia , you can spend your day at some fancy places without paying more than 100 USD</p>

	<p>In Istanbul you can find 4 little islands , called the prince Island , It's very easy to access the island from Istanbul with a minimum charge of 10 TL
	equal 1 euro, Inside the island no cars are allowed to drive, the only exsiting transportation is horses and small motorcycles, The first island is somehow small and you can walk it from side to side by climbing the hill. If you are not a sporty person , you will suffer :) , but its worth it when you see the beach and you feel the urge to touch the water and perhaps swim if its summer, You may find some owners there who would scam you by paying money to access the beach , if so , you can refuse and try the next beach. You better change your cloth and wear your swimming suit before arriving as it's hard to find a place to change, unless you are not shy and willing to do it nudely :) </p>

	<p> Istanbul is full of stores , Istiklal street is very famous there , you can find the biggest stores there like Gucci , Rolex etc.. but i suggest that you escape to buy from the smaller sellers , since many families in Turkey are below powerty line. Dont forget to buy towels there, they are very cheap with best material (Cotton, Bamboo).</p>
